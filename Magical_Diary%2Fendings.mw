Today is a nice day, so I decide to take a walk and enjoy watching the leaves turn colors.

<000003B3:000003EB>
Summer is almost over...I guess I'll be going home soon.

<00000424:00000442>
I really will miss this place.

<0000047B:000004BF>
It's weird to think that when I first came here, I wanted to escape.

<000004F8:00000528>
But now...I wonder if I wouldn't mind staying...

Pops convinced Uncle that it was best if he and Orpheus moved to a city near Los Angeles where they could live comfortably.

<00018BA1:00018BEC>
Uncle was so impressed with my work on the farm, he wanted me to take over.

<00018C35:00018C6C>
Farming was really something that I loved, so I agreed.

Together, Clara and I managed to convince her father to let her go to college in San Francisco.

<00018DD2:00018E26>
Although she lives in the dorms there, she always comes back each weekend to see me.

<00018E81:00018EC7>
Clara finally convinced her father to let her go to community college.

<00018F1B:00018F88>
Thankfully, there are plans to put in a new railway that will connect Fairbrook so some of the bigger cities.

<00018FD1:00019041>
Clara can barely contain her excitement. Personally, I like the idea of being able to visit the city a lot, too.

<0001908A:000190D9>
In the meantime, Jacob's been spending a lot more time at Susana's flower shop.

<00019122:00019195>
I think he's attracted to her sweet nature, and Trent is just happy that such a responsible guy is helping her out.

<00019D65:00019DB4>
A scant few months ago, I was so lost with no direction and no love in my life.

<00019DFD:00019E60>
It seems like just yesterday, I was dragging myself along this trail while Clara raced ahead of me.

<00019EA9:00019EED>
But now, running with her...no, just being with her is my every day.

<00019F36:00019F6A>
